## Overview

This extension allows for a compact glTF representation of multiple variants of an asset, structured to allow easy switching between them at runtime. A typical use case is digital commerce, where a user might be presented with e.g. a pair of sneakers and the ability to switch between different colours.

We introduce a simple tag-based scheme, that allows for high-level runtime swapping between which `material` is used to shade a given `mesh primitive`:

```javascript
"meshes": [
    {
        "primitives": [
            {
                "attributes": {
                "POSITION": 0,
                "NORMAL": 1,
                },
                "indices": 2,
                "material": 0,
                "extensions": {
                    "FB_material_variants" : {
                        "mapping": [
                            {
                                "tags": [ "sneaker_yellow" ],
                                "material": 0,
                            },
                            {
                                "tags": [ "sneaker_red" ],
                                "material": 1,
                            },
                        ],
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

The tag-based approach allows highly selective material switching, e.g. changing the colour of shoe laces only, or wholesale changes across diverse geometry, by reusing the same tags in switches across many distinct mesh primitives. In the typical case, many tags will be active, e.g. `['sneaker_red', 'laces_gold']`. This approach also eases composition: a scene built from several different models (that use this extension) works as one would expect.

## Interaction with existing glTF functionality

Ultimately, this extension is a compression scheme: it is a way to compactly represent multiple assets that have a lot in common (e.g. most geometry, some textures). It's most meaningful for the self-contained binary format GLB, where each asset must carry all its data, including what's shared with the other variants.

If we allow images and buffers to source from URLs, then we could come up with quite sophisticated mechanisms where geometry and textures are all loaded separately & dynamically, and bandwidth savings thus out of clever loaders and a URL caching mechanism.

Even then, though, it's meaningful to have an extension that provides a tag->material mapping on a common format. From the point of business logic, this is essentially an API on the asset.


## Implications for Applications and APIs

How does an application communicate to a glTF engine what the initial variant state should be? How does it submit a runtime request for a different configuration? It's out of scope for this extension to constrain or mandate an engine's public API, but a useful implementation will require something of the sort.

A basic implementation could simply re-parse the whole model whenever the configuration changes. It's expected that more sophisticated viewers will do upfront work in order to optimise for low-latency switching between variants.

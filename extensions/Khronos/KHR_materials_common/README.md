## Status

Draft (not ratified yet)

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF draft 1.0 spec.

## Overview

This extension defines a set of common materials and lights for use with glTF. 

glTF does not define a lighting model, instead relegating shading of visuals to GLSL shader code defined within techniques in the glTF file. For many use cases, it is desirable to use commonly understood and implemented shading techniques, such as Blinn and Lambert.
